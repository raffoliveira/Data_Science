# Notebooks

This repository is about some scripts about Data Science using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb).

There are many topics like scraping, deep learning, word clouds, recover photos, games, data visualization, and some tricks in Python.

Some of scripts were made using examples of community online like [Data Hackers](https://datahackers.com.br/), [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/) and [Medium](https://medium.com/topic/data-science).

### Projects

* [Data Quarantine](https://github.com/raffoliveira/Data_science/tree/main/Data_quarantine)

Classes of a short course of data science during quarantine in 2020

* [Datasets](https://github.com/raffoliveira/Data_science/tree/main/Datasets)

Folder of several datasets.

* [Deep Learning](https://github.com/raffoliveira/Data_science/tree/main/Deep_learning) 

Simple script of deep learning using keras.

* [Games](https://github.com/raffoliveira/Data_science/tree/main/Games)

Two games, 2D Snake and Dino Dinossaur developed using pygame library.

* [Itau Processo Seletivo](https://github.com/raffoliveira/Data_science/tree/main/Itau_processo_seletivo)

This is part of Itau process involving some tasks about machine learning and models. There are some models developed like clustering, PCA, KMeans, models of classification (Logistic, Naives, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Network), Boosting (Gradient, XGBoost and ADA Boosting), and Regression (Linear, Decision Tree Regressor, L1 and L2 Regression, Elastic Net, and SVM)

* [Loading big files](https://github.com/raffoliveira/Data_science/tree/main/Loading_large_excel_files)

Some ways to load big files specially files in format excel. 

* [PandasxDask](https://github.com/raffoliveira/Data_science/tree/main/PandasxDask)

It's a simple comparative between Pandas and Dask about reading a big files.

* [Performance Analysis](https://github.com/raffoliveira/Data_science/tree/main/Performance_analysis)

Some script in google colab about System Performance Analysis, the last subject of my graduation in Computer Engineering. This analysis is about PCA (Principal Component Analysis), normalization, and clustering with K-Means.

* [Pingouin](https://github.com/raffoliveira/Data_science/tree/main/Pingouin_statistic)

Pingouin is a statistical package in python based in Pandas and Numpy. It allows users to get many stats functions and plots like ANOVA, Circular statistics, Q-Q plot, Bland-Altman plot, Linear/logistic regression, and many others.

* [Recover old photos](https://github.com/raffoliveira/Data_science/tree/main/Recover_old_photos)

This a implementation of CVPR2020 to recover old photos and bring them to life. The original name of project is **Old Photo Restoration via Deep Latent Space Translation** and the official repository is [here](https://github.com/microsoft/Bringing-Old-Photos-Back-to-Life). To run code is necessary Python>3.6, GPU's and CUDA installed.

* [Scraping](https://github.com/raffoliveira/Data_science/tree/main/Scraping)

There are many ways to scrap information from websites. In this script I use [selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) framework to get information about interactive charts. I used selenium webdriver to help the access over web browser (google chrome) and get the data.

* [Sweetviz](https://github.com/raffoliveira/Data_science/tree/main/Sweetviz)

Library [sweetviz](https://pypi.org/project/sweetviz/) is dedicated to generate beautiful and simple visualizations using self-contained HTML application. It's so helpful during Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

* [Tricks](https://github.com/raffoliveira/Data_science/tree/main/Tricks_Python)

Some scripts to help when we run severals model in machine learning using os and joblib libraries: save different models in a specific directory, run different models in a specific directory, run multiple files using arguments parse in command line, looping in a directory with multiple files.

* [Vaex](https://github.com/raffoliveira/Data_science/tree/main/Vaex)

Introdutory script of Vaex, a library for lazy out-of-core dataframes (similar to Pandas) to process big tabular datasets.

* [Whatsapp](https://github.com/raffoliveira/Data_science/tree/main/Whatsapp)

Analysis of personal group on Whatsapp using  emoji and wordcloud libraries. I used the data that we can extract from whatsapp application. The goal is understand the behaviour of people in this group. The insights measure the word frequency (which word is used the most), which day of the week and time has the most sendings, which person sent the most messages, the usage profile of words.  
  
* [WordCloud](https://github.com/raffoliveira/Data_science/tree/main/Word_clouds):
 
Creating a word cloud through text using library wordcloud. This library allow us to remove stop words (words with little meaning like pronouns, articles, numbers, verbs, etc...)
